    "description": "While the whole world closes their eyes and ignores, the brave Ukrainian heroes fight for our Motherland, the security of Europe and the rest of the civilized world. Shouldn’t the world HAVE LOST THE ROD, shouldn’t everyone be so afraid of Putin that they can’t stand up to help Ukraine? The Ukrainian army is strong, our soldiers do not know fear, because the truth and God are on our side. Traditional sculpture created by Sergii Shaulis.",
