    "description": "Ukraine is a nation of strong faith and Western ideology and culture. It is a country where Orthodox, Catholic, and Protestants stand side by side in the worship of God. It is also an open society where other religions and views are welcomed without condemnation or restriction. Prayer is the Power of God worked out through the mouths of His children. May He bring peace; Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy.",
