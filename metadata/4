    "description": "The Javelin is a man-portable fire-and-forget anti-tank missile. Its HEAT warhead is capable of defeating modern tanks by hitting them from above where their armor is thinnest, and is also useful against fortifications in a direct attack flight. Thanks to allies all over the world, Ukraine has many of these in service. It is reported that these helped to eliminate 500+ pieces of Russian equipment in the first 24 hours of the conflict. In the hands of the Saint, the Javelin will stop the imperialistic Russian columns in their tracks.",
