It’s HEAT warhead is capable of defeating modern tanks by hitting them from above where their armor is thinnest, and is also useful against fortifications in a direct attack flight. Thanks to the partners all over the world, Ukraine got these bad boys at the service. After the first 24 hours of Ukraine-Russian conflict it was reported by Ukrainian side that 500+ units of Russian hardware were destroyed. Javelin has made it’s contribution and that’s why it is called ‘Saint Javelin’ now. Amen.",
